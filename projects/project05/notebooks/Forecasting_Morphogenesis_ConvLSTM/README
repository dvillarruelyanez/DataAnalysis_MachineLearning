# Deep Learning for Spatiotemporal Forecasting of Embryonic Development

Predicting morphological dynamics of Zebrafish embryos using Stacked ConvLSTMs and computer vision pipelines.

Project Overview

This project implements a spatiotemporal deep learning framework to forecast the development of Zebrafish embryos from 2 to 16 hours post-fertilization (hpf). The model is designed to handle high-resolution brightfield microscopy data across three distinct genetic phenotypes:
* Wild Type (WT).
* BMP Mutants.
* Nodal Mutants.

The core architecture uses Stacked ConvLSTMs to learn cellular dynamics, enabling both one-step-ahead forecasting and autoregressive trajectory generation.

## Key Features

* Custom Data Pipeline: End-to-end processing including phase-correlation drift correction, adaptive masking, and tensor normalization.
* Loss Function: A composite loss designed to optimize structural fidelity:
  $$L_{total} = 0.6 \cdot MSE + 0.2 \cdot Gradient + 0.2 \cdot SSIM$$
* Robust Architecture: 3-layer ConvLSTM (32, 32, 64 filters) preserving spatial resolution (128x128).
* Evaluation Protocols: Rigorous testing under both One-Step (short-term) and Autoregressive (long-term) inference regimes.
