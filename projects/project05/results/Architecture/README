* Figure1A:
    Illustrates the **Stacked ConvLSTM** architecture, consisting of three recurrent layers that process sequences of 10 past frames to predict the subsequent developmental state ($t+1$). 
* Figure 1B:
    Details the internal gating mechanism (Input, Forget, and Output gates) of a single ConvLSTM cell.
